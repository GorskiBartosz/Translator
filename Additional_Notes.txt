I have used the EntityFramework with "Code First" wrokflow.

For its configuration I used those commands in NuGet Package Manager Console:

1.
PM> Install-Package EntityFramework

2.
PM> Enable-Migrations

3.
PM> Add-Migration CreateTranslationClass

4.
PM> Update-Database

I have also used bootstrap theme form website https://bootswatch.com/3/united/

Theme was made by Thomas Park. Contact him at thomas@bootswatch.com.

Code released under the MIT License.

Based on Bootstrap. Icons from Font Awesome. Web fonts from Google.
